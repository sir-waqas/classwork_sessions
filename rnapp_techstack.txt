1. npm install --save react react-redux
2. Creat src/App.js and import the required libs:
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { createStore } from "redux";
import reducers from "./reducers";
import { Header } from "./components/common";
import LibraryList from "./components/LibraryList";

3. Create a Functional Component:

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={createStore(reducers)}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Header headerText="Tech Stack" />
        <LibraryList />
      </View>
    </Provider>
  );
};

4. Export the Component:
export default App
Please don't forget to refer to this App.js in your main index.js file as well.

5. Create src/reducers/index.js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import LibraryReducer from "./LibraryReducer";
import SelectionReducer from "./SelectionReducer";

export default combineReducers({
  libraries: LibraryReducer,
  selectedLibraryId: SelectionReducer
});

6. Create src/reducers/LibraryReducer.js
import data from "./LibraryList.json";

export default () => data;

7. Create src/reducers/LibraryList.json and paste the following data:

8. Create src/reducers/SelectionReducer.js and paste the following:

  switch (action.type) {
    case "select_library":
      return action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
