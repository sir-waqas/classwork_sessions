1. npm install --save react react-redux
2. Creat src/App.js and import the required libs:
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { createStore } from "redux";
import reducers from "./reducers";
import { Header } from "./components/common";
import LibraryList from "./components/LibraryList";

3. Create a Functional Component:

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={createStore(reducers)}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Header headerText="Tech Stack" />
        <LibraryList />
      </View>
    </Provider>
  );
};

4. Export the Component:
export default App
Please don't forget to refer to this App.js in your main index.js file as well.
